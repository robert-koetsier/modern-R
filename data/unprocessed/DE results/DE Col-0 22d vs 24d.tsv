Encodes a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-2 of the plant specific ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (RAP2.3).  The protein contains one AP2 domain. There are 5 members in this subfamily including RAP2.2 AND RAP2.12.It is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator through the GCC-box. It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.   It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3.

Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.

Encodes a cytosolic protein with transglucosidase and amylomaltase activity.   It is an essential component of the pathway from starch to sucrose and cellular metabolism in leaves at night. The protein binds to heteroglycans and utilizes glucose, mannose and xylose as acceptors. Fucose and galactose can also act as acceptors but less efficiently than the previous three. It was also was also recently reported to act on maltodextrins.  On the other hand, arabinose and fructose were not efficiently used.  Its role probably includes metabolizing maltose exported from the chloroplast. Studies using maltose extracted from the double mutant be2-1 be3-2 showed that this enzyme is preferentially active of &#946;-maltose.

Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. In Arabidopsis, mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants. It also attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence and cell death. This gene product is also involved in nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.

Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a closed conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an open conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.

Encodes a cytochrome P-450 gene that is involved in leaf blade expansion by controlling polar cell expansion in the leaf length direction. Member of the CYP90C CYP450 family. ROT3 was shown to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis, most likely in the conversion step of typhasterol (TY) to castasterone (CS). As 6-deoxo-CS was unable to restore the phenotype of rot3-1, it has been postulated that ROT3 might be specifically involved in the conversion of TY to CS in the C6-oxidation pathway of brassinolide. Recently, CYP90C1 was shown to catalyse the C-23 hydroxylation of several brassinosteroids (the enzyme has a broad specificity for 22-hydroxylated substrates).

Similar to mitochondrial alternative oxidase.  im mutants have a variegated phenotype and fail to differentiate chloroplasts in the majority of their cells under high light intensity continuous illumination. The white tissues of immutans accumulate phytoene, a non-colored C40 carotenoid intermediate. This suggests that immutans controls, either directly or indirectly, the activity of phytoene desaturase (PDS), the enzyme that converts phytoene to zeta-carotene in higher plants. However, im is not the structural gene for PDS. It is located in the lumenar face of the thylakoid membrane. IM is expressed ubiquitously in plant tissues.

This gene encodes the second largest, catalytic subunit of the nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (aka RNA polymerase D). The NRPD2 protein is found at nuclear foci that overlap or are adjacent to chromocentromeres but are not fully coincident with chromocentromeres. The loss of NRPD2 leads to the loss of cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S genes and AtSN1 retroelements but has no discernible effect on centromere repeat methylation. This suggests that Pol IV primarily affects facultative heterochromatin rather than constitutive heterochromatin.

At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central %E2%80%98dynamin 2%E2%80%98 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.

Originally identified as a mutation that causes floral organs to fuse together. About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.

Homologous to the maize transcription factor Viviparous-1. Full length ABI3 protein binds to the highly conserved RY motif [DNA motif CATGCA(TG)], present in many seed-specific promoters, and the B3 domains of this transcription factor is necessary for the specific interaction with the RY element. Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family. In addition, both FUS3 and LEC1 regulate positively the abundance of the ABI3 protein in the seed.  Alternative splicing of ABI3 is developmentally regulated by SUA (AT3G54230).

Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970).

The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus.

Regulates several developmental  processes, including photoperiod-mediated flowering, phytochrome B signaling,  circadian clock, carbohydrate metabolism, and cold stress response.  The gene's transcription is controlled by the circadian clock and it is post-transcriptionally regulated by light and dark. Forms a complex with FKF1 on the CO promoter to regulate CO expression.

Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment.

It has been co-purified with the callose synthase complex and may transfer UDP-glucose from sucrose synthase to the callose synthase and thus help form a substrate channel for the synthesis of callose at the forming cell plate. Induced by salicylic acid. Independent of NPR1 for their induction by salicylic acid. UGT1 encodes a protein with glucosyltransferase activity with high sequence homology to UGT2 (AT1G05530). It belongs to an UGT subfamily that binds UDP-glucose but not UDP-glucuronate, UDP-galactose, or UDP-rhamnose as the glycosyl donor. UGT1 was shown to be able to use abscisic acid as glycosylation substrate in the presence of UDP-glucose. UGT1/UGT75B1 catalyzes the formation of the p-aminobenzoate-glucose ester in vitro and in vivo. It appears to be the enzyme predominantly responsible for pABA-Glc formation in Arabidopsis based on assays in leaves, flowers, and siliques.

The LIP1 gene encodes a small GTPase that influences the light input pathway of the plant circadian network. An MBP:LIP1 fusion protein has GTP hydrolyzing abilities in vitro. In plants, LIP1 seems to play a negative role in regulating circadian period that can be suppressed by light. LIP1 also seems to negatively affect light-pulse-dependent resetting of the clock, especially during the first portion of the subjective evening. LIP1 expression levels are not significantly affected by the circadian clock in seedlings grown under LL conditions. The levels of the YFP:LIP1 protein expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, shows a low amplitude variation, with protein levels peaking near the beginning of subjective night under LL conditions. In hypocotyl epidermal cells of dark and light-grown seedlings, a YFP:LIP1 fusion protein can be seen in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and does not cluster in nuclear speckles. LIP1 may also be involved in photomorphogenesis.

Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO11 belongs to the clade I, with AtMLO4 and AtMLO14. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth (in primary root), in root tips and lateral root primordia, and in very young leaves, and in flowers and fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants.

XPB proteins are involved in both DNA repair and transcription, they are component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and are responsible for DNA helicase activity during nucleotide (nt) excision repair (NER). Complementation assays in yeast rad25 mutant strains suggest the involvement of AtXPB2 in DNA repair. Although both genes are expressed in a constitutive manner during the plant life cycle, Northern blot analyses suggest that light modulates the expression level of both XPB copies.

Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal SKL targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.

Encodes a protein that promotes splicing of type II introns. otp51 mutants fail to splice intron 2 of plastid ycf3 transcripts, a factor required for the assembly of Photosystem I. Therefore, homozygous otp51 mutants have profound photosynthetic defects and can only survive in sucrose-supplemented in vitro cultures under low light conditions. OTP51 may also be involved in splicing several other transcripts and precursor forms of the trnL, trnG, trnI, and trnA transcripts also accumulate in otp51 mutants. Although OTP51 shares some homology with DNA endonucleases, it lacks key catalytic residues suggesting that it does not participate in DNA cleavage.

Photoreceptor activity requires light-induced homodimerisation of the N-terminal CNT1 domains of CRY1. Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. The C-terminal domain of the protein undergoes a light dependent conformational change.  Also involved in response to circadian rhythm. Mutants exhibit long hypocotyl under blue light and are out of phase in their response to circadian rhythm.  CRY1 is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm.  Different subcellular pools of CRY1 have different functions during photomorphogenesis of Arabidopsis seedlings.

MMZ4/UEV1D encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1D can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ4/UEV1D transcripts are found in most plant organs, like the other three MMZ/UEV1 family members, but it is normally present at higher levels. In addition, MMZ4/UEV1D is the only family member whose transcripts are detected in pollen. However, MMZ4/UEV1D transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. uev1d-1 mutants are more sensitive than wild type plants to the DNA damaging agent MMS in seed germination and pollen germination assays.

Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that is plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG.  In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.

Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. %01H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10%E2%80%9320 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

AT5G65700	BAM1	37.322	-0.63343	0.4073	-1.5552	0.1199		full_name=BARELY ANY MERISTEM 1. Leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinase family protein. Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.

AT2G33860	ETT	64.782	-0.49867	0.3255	-1.532	0.12552		full_name=ETTIN. Transcriptional factor B3 family protein / auxin-responsive factor AUX/IAA-like protein. ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF.

Mature leaves of these mutants accumulate amounts of starch up to seven times greater than those in wild-type leaves. NMR analysis of the mutants, suggests that the gene is specifically involved in the phosphorylation of the glucosyl residues of starch at the C6 position.

AT4G12970	STOMAGEN	18.889	-0.72678	0.50719	-1.433	0.15187		full_name=STOMAGEN. stomagen. Encodes a cysteine-rich peptide, a secretory factor that is produced in the mesophyll cells and acts on the epidermis to increase stomatal formation.  Its mature form is a 45-aa peptide with three intramolecular disulfide bonds.  It is proposed that STOMAGEN increases stomatal number by competing with two negative regulators of stomatal density, EPF1 and EPF2, possibly through direct interaction with the receptor-like protein TMM. Its transcript levels change after inducing MUTE expression in a mute background.

Encodes BOP2, a cytoplasmic and nuclear-localized NPR1 like protein with BTB/POZ domain and ankyrin repeats. Interacts with BOP1 and appears to be genetically redundant with BOP1.bop1/bop2 double mutants have longer leaves, often with leaflets on the petiole, asymmetric flowers with extra organs and no nectaries. Also defective in floral organ abscission.  BOP1/2 promotes floral meristem fate and determinacy in a pathway targetting APETALA1 and AGAMOUS-LIKE24. PUCHI, BOP1 and BOP2 are redundantly required for expression of LFY and AP1. BOP2 is expressed in valve margin. Misexpression in stems causes short internodes and ectopic biosynthesis of lignin. BOP2 activity is antagonistic to BP (At4g08150) and PNY (At5g02030). BOP3 expression is restricted to pedicel axils by BP and PNY. BOP2 promotes KNAT6 (At1g23380) expression.

Encodes brassinosteroid (BR) signalling protein that accumulates in the nucleus as dephosphorylated form in response to BRs. Is phosphorylated by the BIN2 GSK3 kinase. It synergistically interacts with BIM1 to bind to E box sequences (CANNTG). The protein contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), followed by a highly conserved amino-terminal domain (N) shared by all family members, a BIN2 phosphorylation domain (P), a PEST motif, involved in protein degradation in the absence of BR, and a carboxyl-terminal domain. BES1 can interact with the ELF6 and REF6 Jumonji N/C-domain containing proteins and may direct them to modify histone methylation upstream of some brassinosteroid responsive-genes. Works with BRAVO to regulate QC division in the root.

Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK3 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  CPK6 is also a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK family.

The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. The THIC transcript is regulated by a TPP riboswitch in the 3' UTR. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.

It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.

MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.

Encodes a membrane localized protein with similarity to receptor kinases which is involved in epidermal cell differentiation. Flowers of mutants have disorganized ovule integument growth and abnormal sepal margins. In the roots, mutants initiate more lateral roots but fewer laterals actually emerge due to defects in lateral root formation. Mutants also display disorganized columella. The root phenotypes can be traced to abnormalities in asymmetric divisions in the pericycle and root apex.  Conflicting data regarding the role of the kinase domain- which may or may not be required for function. Complementation studies indicate that the C-terminal domain is also not required for signaling function. May be regulated by protein turnover which is mediated by endocytic processes.

JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor with three zinc finger domains. jkd mutants show a number of root patterning defects including ectopic periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. jkd mutants also have a reduced number of meristematic cells in their roots. JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.

The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, which we named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.

Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

MGP appears to be a direct transcriptional target of SHR and SCR, based on promoter binding assays, though it is not expressed in the QC, based on in situ hybridizations.

Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity.

PPD1 (and its paralog, PPD2) encode plant-specific putative DNA-binding proteins. PPD1 and PPD2 are not found in grasses. Overexpression of PPD reduces lamina size by promoting the early arrest of dispersed meristematic cells DMC proliferation during leaf and silique development. Deletion of the PPD locus increases leaf lamina size and results in dome-shaped rather than flat leaves. Siliques are also altered in shape because of extra lamina growth. The curvature of a deltappd leaf reflects the difference between excess growth of the lamina and a limitation to the extension capacity of its perimeter.

Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain. Negative regulator of root hair growth. PID kinase activity is critical for the inhibition of root hair growth and for maintaining  the proper subcellular localization of PID.

Encodes an immunophilin, FKBP20-2, that belongs to the FK-506 binding protein (FKBP) subfamily functioning as peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) in protein folding. FKBP20-2 has a unique pair of cysteines at the C terminus and was found to be reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) (itself reduced by NADPH by means of NADP-Trx reductase). The FKBP20-2 protein, which contains only two of the five amino acids required for catalysis, showed a low level of PPIase activity that was unaffected on reduction by Trx.  Genetic disruption of the FKBP20-2 gene provide evidence that FKBP20-2 participates specifically in the accumulation of the PSII supercomplex in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen by means of a mechanism that has yet to be determined.

H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. %01H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10%E2%80%9320 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

But, the submitted sequence of 110 nucleotides is only part of the 160 nucleotide sequence predicted by Northern blotting. It is assumed that a 5' portion of the gene is missing and its 5' end has not been conclusively mapped. Sequence analysis of this snoRNA suggests that it may not function like other C/D box family members that modify rRNAs or snRNAs. Its true biological target remains unknown. The promoter of this snoRNA has hallmarks of the snRNA promoters targeted by RNA polymerase II,  indicating that it might also have a TMG (2,2,7 trimethyguanosine) cap. SnoRNA108 may also play a novel role in ribosome biogenesis (Marker 2002).

The protein binds abscisic acid (ABA) and is predicted to function as an ABA receptor. It has GTP-binding and GTPase activity and binds to ABA more effectively in the presence of GDP. GTG2 binds to GPA1, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.  GPA1 (in its GTP-bound state) affects the GTP binding and GTPase activity of GTG2 and may act to down-regulate GTG2 binding to ABA. GTG2 is widely expressed throughout the plant and appears to be involved in the regulation of several ABA-dependent responses including seed germination, plant development, and promotion of stomatal closure. GTG2 transcript levels do not appear to change in response to ABA or abiotic stresses.

Encodes a syntaxin localized at the plasma membrane (SYR1, Syntaxin Related Protein 1, also known as SYP121, PENETRATION1/PEN1).  SYR1/PEN1 is a member of the SNARE superfamily proteins.  SNARE proteins are involved in cell signaling, vesicle traffic, growth and development.  SYR1/PEN1 functions in positioning anchoring of the KAT1 K+ channel protein at the plasma membrane. Transcription is upregulated by abscisic acid, suggesting a role in ABA signaling.  Also functions in non-host resistance against barley powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis sp. hordei.  SYR1/PEN1 is a nonessential component of the preinvasive resistance against Colletotrichum fungus. Required for mlo resistance. The syp121 point mutation results in stomatal phenotypes that reduce CO2 assimilation, slow vegetative growth and increase water use efficiency in the whole plant, conditional upon high light intensities and low relative humidity.

AtVAMP711 is a member of Synaptobrevin-like AtVAMP7C, v-SNARE (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein family. SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.

JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2.

MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.
