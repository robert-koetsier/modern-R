Encodes a novel Myc-related bHLH transcription factor that has transcriptional activation activity in the dark.  It is a key negative regulator of phytochrome-mediated seed germination and acts by inhibiting chlorophyll biosynthesis, light-mediated suppression of hypocotyl elongation and far-red light-mediated suppression of seed germination, and promoting negative gravitropism in hypocotyls.  Light reduces this activity in a phy-dependent manner.  The protein preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB), is physically associated with APRR1/TOC1 and is degraded in red (R) and far-red (FR) light through the ubiquitin (ub)-26S proteasome pathway to optimize photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis.  It also negatively regulates GA3 oxidase expression.

Transcriptional factor B3 family protein / auxin-responsive factor AUX/IAA-like protein. ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF.

Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity.

At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central %E2%80%98dynamin 2%E2%80%98 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.

Encodes a small glycine-rich RNA binding protein that is part of a negative-feedback loop through which AtGRP7 regulates the circadian oscillations of its own transcript.  Gene expression is induced by cold. GRP7 appears to promote stomatal opening and reduce tolerance under salt and dehydration stress conditions, but, promotes stomatal closing and thereby increases stress tolerance under conditions of cold tolerance. Loss of function mutations have increased susceptibility to pathogens suggesting a role in mediating innate immune response. Mutants are also late flowering in a non-photoperiodic manner and are responsive to vernalization suggesting an interaction with the autonomous flowering pathway.   There is a reduction of mRNA export from the nucleus in grp7 mutants. GRP7:GFP fusion proteins can be found in the cytosol and nucleus.

PPD1 (and its paralog, PPD2) encode plant-specific putative DNA-binding proteins. PPD1 and PPD2 are not found in grasses. Overexpression of PPD reduces lamina size by promoting the early arrest of dispersed meristematic cells DMC proliferation during leaf and silique development. Deletion of the PPD locus increases leaf lamina size and results in dome-shaped rather than flat leaves. Siliques are also altered in shape because of extra lamina growth. The curvature of a deltappd leaf reflects the difference between excess growth of the lamina and a limitation to the extension capacity of its perimeter.

Membrane-bound protein serine/threonine kinase that functions as blue light photoreceptor in redundancy with PHO1. Involved in stomatal opening, chloroplast movement and phototropism. Mediates blue light-induced growth enhancements. PHOT1 and PHOT2 mediate blue light-dependent activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cell protoplasts. PHOT2 possesses two LOV (LOV1 and LOV2, for light-oxygen-voltage-sensing) domains involved in FMN-binding and a C-terminus forming a serine/threonine kinase domain. LOV2 acts as an inhibitor of phototropin kinase in the dark, and light cancels the inhibition through cysteine-FMN adduct formation. LOV1 in contrast acts as an attenuator of photoactivation.  Localized to the Golgi apparatus under the induction of blue light.

Encodes a protein homologous to  translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) from Drosophila. In flies, TCTP functions guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the TOR signaling pathway. TCTP is expressed throughout the plant with highest levels seen in meristematic regions of the shoot and root. Loss of function alleles are not transmitted through the male gametophyte due to defects in pollen tube growth. Hypomorphs, generated through RNAi, are dwarf and have smaller cells. These plants also have defects in lateral and primary root growth as well as root hair growth. The phenotypes are similar to TOR mutants suggesting that TCTP functions in the is pathway in Arabidopsis as well.

Originally identified as a mutation that causes floral organs to fuse together. About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.

Binds Ca(2+) and, as a consequence, undergoes conformational changes. CML24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2- to 15-fold in  plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat,  cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid  (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid. However, CML24 protein accumulation changes were not  detectable. The putative CML24 regulatory region confers reporter expression at sites  of predicted mechanical stress; in regions undergoing growth; in vascular tissues and  various floral organs; and in stomata, trichomes, and hydathodes. CML24-underexpressing transgenics are resistant to ABA inhibition of germination and seedling growth, are defective in long-day induction of flowering, and have enhanced tolerance to CoCl(2), molybdic acid, ZnSO(4), and MgCl(2).  Also regulates nitric oxide levels.

Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970).

A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO8 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO5, AtMLO7, AtMLO9, and AtMLO10. The gene is expressed during seedling growth, in cotyledons and hypocotyl, and in fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

Encodes a member of the CP90A family, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase which converts 6-deoxocathasterone to 6-deoxoteasterone in the late C6 oxidation pathway and cathasterone to teasterone in the early C6 oxidation pathway of brassinolide biosynthesis.  Expressed in cotyledons and leaves. Mutants display de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in the dark, dwarfism, male sterility and activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The expression of the gene using a CPD promoter:LUC fusion construct was shown to be under circadian and light control. Additionally, the circadian regulation was shown to be independent of BR levels as it remains unchanged in <i>bri1</i> mutant lines. CPD appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through a BRI1-mediated signaling pathway that affects FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses.

Encodes a membrane localized protein with similarity to receptor kinases which is involved in epidermal cell differentiation. Flowers of mutants have disorganized ovule integument growth and abnormal sepal margins. In the roots, mutants initiate more lateral roots but fewer laterals actually emerge due to defects in lateral root formation. Mutants also display disorganized columella. The root phenotypes can be traced to abnormalities in asymmetric divisions in the pericycle and root apex.  Conflicting data regarding the role of the kinase domain- which may or may not be required for function. Complementation studies indicate that the C-terminal domain is also not required for signaling function. May be regulated by protein turnover which is mediated by endocytic processes.

Complementation assays in yeast rad25 mutant strains suggest the involvement of AtXPB2 in DNA repair. Although both genes are expressed in a constitutive manner during the plant life cycle, Northern blot analyses suggest that light modulates the expression level of both XPB copies.

It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.

Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.

The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. The THIC transcript is regulated by a TPP riboswitch in the 3' UTR. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.

Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. In Arabidopsis, mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants. It also attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence and cell death. This gene product is also involved in nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.

CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK3 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  CPK6 is also a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK family.

It is assumed that a 5' portion of the gene is missing and its 5' end has not been conclusively mapped. Sequence analysis of this snoRNA suggests that it may not function like other C/D box family members that modify rRNAs or snRNAs. Its true biological target remains unknown. The promoter of this snoRNA has hallmarks of the snRNA promoters targeted by RNA polymerase II,  indicating that it might also have a TMG (2,2,7 trimethyguanosine) cap. SnoRNA108 may also play a novel role in ribosome biogenesis (Marker 2002).

But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment.

Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a closed conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an open conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.

Belongs to five-member BRX gene family. Arabidopsis BRX genes share high levels of similarity among each others, with several conserved domains. The most distinct is BRX domain - highly conserved in all BRX genes among distantly related species. This protein-protein interaction domain is required and sufficient for BRX activity. BRX encodes a key regulator of cell proliferation and elongation in the root, which has been implicated in the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway as well as regulation of auxin-responsive gene expression. Also involved in cytokinin-mediated inhibition of lateral root initiation.  A loss-of-function allele, named brx-2 in   Rodrigues et al. (2009) Plant Physiol. but changed to brx-3 to resolve nomenclature conflict (Li et al. Planta 2009:229(3):593-603), shows enhanced response to ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth.

Encodes a MYB gene that, when overexpressed ectopically, can induce ectopic trichome formation.  It is a member of subgroup 15, together with WER and GL1.  Members of this subgroup share a conserved motif of 19 amino acids in the putative transcription activation domain at the C-terminal end.  The gene is expressed in leaves, stems, flowers, seeds and roots and quite strongly in trichomes. There is partial functional redundancy between ATMYB23 and GL1.  The two proteins are functionally equivalent with respect to the regulation of trichome initiation but not with respect to trichome branching - which is controlled by MYB23 and not GL1.

JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor with three zinc finger domains. jkd mutants show a number of root patterning defects including ectopic periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. jkd mutants also have a reduced number of meristematic cells in their roots. JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.

Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.

The enzyme can also catalyze the reverse reaction using both UDP-GlcNAc and the less common UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine as substrates. This enzyme can also act on glucose-1-phosphate to produce UDP-glucose.

MMZ4/UEV1D encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1D can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ4/UEV1D transcripts are found in most plant organs, like the other three MMZ/UEV1 family members, but it is normally present at higher levels. In addition, MMZ4/UEV1D is the only family member whose transcripts are detected in pollen. However, MMZ4/UEV1D transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. uev1d-1 mutants are more sensitive than wild type plants to the DNA damaging agent MMS in seed germination and pollen germination assays.

Encodes the VIM3/ORTH1 protein that is similar to VIM1. This protein has an N-terminal PHD domain and two RING domains surrounding an SRA domain. The protein has been shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the former. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro with members of the UBC8 family E2s. Either of the two RING domains present in the protein can promote ubiquitylation in vitro, but, not the PHD domain. Over-expression of ORTH1/VIM3 leads to decreased levels of FWA methylation, increased levels of FWA transcripts, and delayed flowering. Cen180 repeats are also hypomethylated in plants overexpressing this protein.

A member of the RPD gene family - there are13 annotated genes and one EST encoding RPD1-like proteins in Arabidopsis. Shows no homology to any protein of known function. Abundant expression found in the shoot apex and the root. rpd1 mutant is a temperature-sensitive mutant isolated on the basis of the impairment in adventitious roots formation in hypocotyl region. Also, disruption of the RPD1 gene by a T-DNA insertion caused embryogenesis arrest at the globular to transition stages. This phenotype is consistent with the hypothesized function of RPD1 in the maintenance of active cell proliferation.

Ascorbate peroxidases are enzymes that scavenge hydrogen peroxide in plant cells.  Eight types of APX have been described for Arabidopsis: three cytosolic (APX1, APX2, APX6), two chloroplastic types (stromal sAPX, thylakoid tAPX), and three microsomal (APX3, APX4, APX5) isoforms. At least part of the induction of heat shock proteins during light stress in Arabidopsis is mediated by H2O2 that is scavenged by APX1. Expression of the gene is downregulated in the presence of paraquat, an inducer of photoxidative stress.
AT4G27630	GTG2	141.46	-0.092613	0.20138	-0.4599	0.64559	0.99997	full_name=GPCR-type G protein 2. GPCR-type G protein 2. Encodes a GPCR-type G protein receptor with nine predicted transmembrane domains. The protein binds abscisic acid (ABA) and is predicted to function as an ABA receptor. It has GTP-binding and GTPase activity and binds to ABA more effectively in the presence of GDP. GTG2 binds to GPA1, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.  GPA1 (in its GTP-bound state) affects the GTP binding and GTPase activity of GTG2 and may act to down-regulate GTG2 binding to ABA. GTG2 is widely expressed throughout the plant and appears to be involved in the regulation of several ABA-dependent responses including seed germination, plant development, and promotion of stomatal closure. GTG2 transcript levels do not appear to change in response to ABA or abiotic stresses.

AtVAMP711 is a member of Synaptobrevin-like AtVAMP7C, v-SNARE (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein family. SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.

Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion.

Separase is a capase family protease required for the release of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis and mitosis.  Arabidopsis separase contains a predicted 2Fe2S-ferredoxin domain that is not present in the proteins of other organisms. Also contains a putative EF-hand calcium binding domain. Mutant seeds exhibited embryo arrest at the globular stage. The endosperm also exhibited a weak titan-like phenotype. Transgenic plants expressing AESP RNA interference (RNAi) from the meiosis-specific DMC1 promoter exhibited alterations in chromosome segregation during meiosis I and II that resulted in polyads containing from one to eight microspores. Plays an essential role in embryo development.  Required for the removal of cohesin from meiotic chromosomes and establishment of meiotic nuclear domains. This gene was also identified through the rsw4 mutant. Lines carrying recessive, temperature-sensitive mutations exhibit reduced anisotropic growth at 30 degrees Celsius. Microtubules and cellulose microfibrils are not depleted or disoriented in the mutants at the restrictive temperature.

Protein has two plant-specific (AP2/EREB) DNA-binding domains and is involved in the control of storage compound biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Mutants have wrinkled seed phenotype, due to a defect in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols. Transgenic sGsL plants (21-day-old) grown on 6% sucrose for 24 hours had 2-fold increase in levels of expressions (sGsL line carries a single copy of T-DNA containing the Spomin::GUS-Spomin::LUC dual reporter genes in the upper arm of chromosome 5 of ecotype Col-0. The sporamin .minimal. promoter directs sugar-inducible expression of the LUC and GUS reporters in leaves). Regulation by LEC2 promotes fatty acid accumulation during seed maturation.

MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation.

Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

JAZ1 is a nuclear-localized protein involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2.

The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, which we named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.

H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. %01H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10%E2%80%9320 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period.

Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal SKL targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.

DCP1 forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP2 (At5g13570) and VCS (VARICOSE) (At3g13300). However, unlike DCP2, DCP1 itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. The protein was shown by immunoprecipitation not to interact with DCP2.

Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that is plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG.  In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.

Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. %01H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10%E2%80%9320 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

ChiC encodes a Class V chitinase that is a part of glycoside hydrolase family 18 based on CAZy groupings. It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.

And there is evidence that S1P can cleave bZIP17 in vitro.

MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

Homologous to the maize transcription factor Viviparous-1. Full length ABI3 protein binds to the highly conserved RY motif [DNA motif CATGCA(TG)], present in many seed-specific promoters, and the B3 domains of this transcription factor is necessary for the specific interaction with the RY element. Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family. In addition, both FUS3 and LEC1 regulate positively the abundance of the ABI3 protein in the seed.  Alternative splicing of ABI3 is developmentally regulated by SUA (AT3G54230).

Encodes a protein that promotes splicing of type II introns. otp51 mutants fail to splice intron 2 of plastid ycf3 transcripts, a factor required for the assembly of Photosystem I. Therefore, homozygous otp51 mutants have profound photosynthetic defects and can only survive in sucrose-supplemented in vitro cultures under low light conditions. OTP51 may also be involved in splicing several other transcripts and precursor forms of the trnL, trnG, trnI, and trnA transcripts also accumulate in otp51 mutants. Although OTP51 shares some homology with DNA endonucleases, it lacks key catalytic residues suggesting that it does not participate in DNA cleavage.
