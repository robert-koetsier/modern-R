A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. The THIC transcript is regulated by a TPP riboswitch in the 3' UTR. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.

JAZ1 is a nuclear-localized protein involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2.

Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants.

Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.

ChiC encodes a Class V chitinase that is a part of glycoside hydrolase family 18 based on CAZy groupings. It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.

This gene encodes the second largest, catalytic subunit of the nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (aka RNA polymerase D). The NRPD2 protein is found at nuclear foci that overlap or are adjacent to chromocentromeres but are not fully coincident with chromocentromeres. The loss of NRPD2 leads to the loss of cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S genes and AtSN1 retroelements but has no discernible effect on centromere repeat methylation. This suggests that Pol IV primarily affects facultative heterochromatin rather than constitutive heterochromatin.

Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that is plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG.  In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.

Encodes a peroxisomal catalase, highly expressed in bolts and leaves.  mRNA expression patterns show circadian regulation with mRNA levels being high in the subjective early morning. Loss of function mutations have increased H2O2 levels and increased H2O2  sensitivity. Mutants accumulate more toxic ions yet show decreased sensitivity to Li+. This decreased sensitivity is most likely due to an insensitivity to ethylene.  Note that in Queval et al.

Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function.  Very similar to BAM1,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.

Encodes a cytochrome P-450 gene that is involved in leaf blade expansion by controlling polar cell expansion in the leaf length direction. Member of the CYP90C CYP450 family. ROT3 was shown to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis, most likely in the conversion step of typhasterol (TY) to castasterone (CS). As 6-deoxo-CS was unable to restore the phenotype of rot3-1, it has been postulated that ROT3 might be specifically involved in the conversion of TY to CS in the C6-oxidation pathway of brassinolide. Recently, CYP90C1 was shown to catalyse the C-23 hydroxylation of several brassinosteroids (the enzyme has a broad specificity for 22-hydroxylated substrates).

Homologous to the maize transcription factor Viviparous-1. Full length ABI3 protein binds to the highly conserved RY motif [DNA motif CATGCA(TG)], present in many seed-specific promoters, and the B3 domains of this transcription factor is necessary for the specific interaction with the RY element. Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family. In addition, both FUS3 and LEC1 regulate positively the abundance of the ABI3 protein in the seed.  Alternative splicing of ABI3 is developmentally regulated by SUA (AT3G54230).

PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN 1 is one of the two Arabidopsis homologs isolated in yeast two-hybrid screen for interaction partners of maize gene TANGLED1 (TAN1). Based on sequence homology in their motor domains, POK1 and POK2 belong to the kinesin-12 class which also includes the well-characterized group of phragmoplast-associated kinesins AtPAKRPs. Both kinesins are composed of an N-terminal motor domain throughout the entire C terminus and putative cargo binding tail domains. The expression domains for POK1 constructs were more limited than those for POK2; both are expressed in tissues enriched for dividing cells. The phenotype of pok1/pok2 double mutants strongly resembles that of maize tan1 mutants, characterized by misoriented mitotic cytoskeletal arrays and misplaced cell walls.

A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO5 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO7, AtMLO8, AtMLO9, and AtMLO10. The gene is expressed during seedling growth, in cotyledon vascular system, and in stigma, anther and pollen grains; it was not expressed in rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

Encodes a chloroplast-localized  hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP) synthase (HDS), catalyzes the formation of HMBPP from 2-C-methyl-D-erythrytol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP).  The HDS enzyme controls the penultimate steps of the biosynthesis of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) via the MEP pathway and may serve as a metabolic control point for SA-mediated disease resistance. In the light, the electrons required for the reaction catalyzed by HDS are directly provided by the electron flow from photosynthesis via ferredoxin. In the dark however, the enzyme requires an electron shuttle: ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase.

The expression of the gene using a CPD promoter:LUC fusion construct was shown to be under circadian and light control. Additionally, the circadian regulation was shown to be independent of BR levels as it remains unchanged in <i>bri1</i> mutant lines. CPD appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through a BRI1-mediated signaling pathway that affects FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses.

MMZ4/UEV1D encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1D can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ4/UEV1D transcripts are found in most plant organs, like the other three MMZ/UEV1 family members, but it is normally present at higher levels. In addition, MMZ4/UEV1D is the only family member whose transcripts are detected in pollen. However, MMZ4/UEV1D transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. uev1d-1 mutants are more sensitive than wild type plants to the DNA damaging agent MMS in seed germination and pollen germination assays.

JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor with three zinc finger domains. jkd mutants show a number of root patterning defects including ectopic periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. jkd mutants also have a reduced number of meristematic cells in their roots. JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.

Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970).

SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.

IBM1 likely encodes a protein with histone H3mK9 demethylation activity. It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or he CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.

A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in  A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene,  jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin,  glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.

Mutations in IBR3 render   plants resistant to indole-3-butryic acid, a putative storage form of the biologically active auxin IAA  (indole-3-acetic acid). IBR3 is hypothesized to carry out the second step in a  &#946;-oxidation-like process of IBA metabolism in Arabidopsis.  Though its subcellular location has not been determined, IBR3 has a peroxisomal targeting  sequence and  two other putative IBA metabolic enzymes (IBR1 and IBR10)  can be found in this organelle. No specific enzymatic activity has been  documented for IBR3, but double mutant analyses with CHY1 argue against a role for IBR3 in general fatty  acid &#946;-oxidation.

Transcriptional factor B3 family protein / auxin-responsive factor AUX/IAA-like protein. ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF.

Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a closed conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an open conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.

There are 5 members in this subfamily including RAP2.2 AND RAP2.12.It is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator through the GCC-box. It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.   It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3.

Encodes a membrane localized protein with similarity to receptor kinases which is involved in epidermal cell differentiation. Flowers of mutants have disorganized ovule integument growth and abnormal sepal margins. In the roots, mutants initiate more lateral roots but fewer laterals actually emerge due to defects in lateral root formation. Mutants also display disorganized columella. The root phenotypes can be traced to abnormalities in asymmetric divisions in the pericycle and root apex.  Conflicting data regarding the role of the kinase domain- which may or may not be required for function. Complementation studies indicate that the C-terminal domain is also not required for signaling function. May be regulated by protein turnover which is mediated by endocytic processes.

MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

Encodes a novel Myc-related bHLH transcription factor that has transcriptional activation activity in the dark.  It is a key negative regulator of phytochrome-mediated seed germination and acts by inhibiting chlorophyll biosynthesis, light-mediated suppression of hypocotyl elongation and far-red light-mediated suppression of seed germination, and promoting negative gravitropism in hypocotyls.  Light reduces this activity in a phy-dependent manner.  The protein preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB), is physically associated with APRR1/TOC1 and is degraded in red (R) and far-red (FR) light through the ubiquitin (ub)-26S proteasome pathway to optimize photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis.  It also negatively regulates GA3 oxidase expression.

Encodes an immunophilin, FKBP20-2, that belongs to the FK-506 binding protein (FKBP) subfamily functioning as peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) in protein folding. FKBP20-2 has a unique pair of cysteines at the C terminus and was found to be reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) (itself reduced by NADPH by means of NADP-Trx reductase). The FKBP20-2 protein, which contains only two of the five amino acids required for catalysis, showed a low level of PPIase activity that was unaffected on reduction by Trx.  Genetic disruption of the FKBP20-2 gene provide evidence that FKBP20-2 participates specifically in the accumulation of the PSII supercomplex in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen by means of a mechanism that has yet to be determined.

Encodes the heterotrimeric G-protein beta subunit and is involved in organ shape. A significant fraction of the protein is found in the ER.  Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  It seems to be involved in the calcium-mediated response to extracellular ATP.

Encodes a novel component of auxin efflux that is located  apically in the basal cell and is involved during embryogenesis in setting up the apical-basal axis in the embryo.  It is also involved in pattern specification during root development.  In roots, it is expressed at lateral and basal membranes of provascular cells in the meristem and elongation zone, whereas in the columella cells it coincides with the PIN3 domain. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors.

It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.  The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.

At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central %E2%80%98dynamin 2%E2%80%98 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.

Encodes the VIM3/ORTH1 protein that is similar to VIM1. This protein has an N-terminal PHD domain and two RING domains surrounding an SRA domain. The protein has been shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the former. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro with members of the UBC8 family E2s. Either of the two RING domains present in the protein can promote ubiquitylation in vitro, but, not the PHD domain. Over-expression of ORTH1/VIM3 leads to decreased levels of FWA methylation, increased levels of FWA transcripts, and delayed flowering. Cen180 repeats are also hypomethylated in plants overexpressing this protein.

Encodes a PAF1 homolog that is involved in the control of flowering time by elevating FLC expression to a level that creates the vernalization-responsive, winter-annual habit.  Yeast PAF1 is a component of a five-member complex that associates with RNA pol II and is thought to regulate gene expression by recruiting SET1 (a histone 3 Lys 4 [H3-K4] methyl transferase) to the initially transcribed [5'] regions of target chromatin.  Mutants display reduced H3-K4 methylation in both FLC and FLM chromatin.

MADS-box protein encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS C - transcription factor that functions as a repressor of floral transition and contributes to temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Expression is downregulated during cold treatment. Vernalization, FRI and the autonomous pathway all influence the state of FLC chromatin. Both maternal and paternal alleles are reset by vernalization, but their earliest activation differs in timing and location. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 and histone acetylation are associated with active FLC expression, whereas histone deacetylation and histone H3 dimethylation at lysines 9 and 27 are involved in FLC repression. Expression is also repressed by two small RNAs (30- and 24-nt) complementary to the FLC sense strand 3? to the polyA site. The small RNAs are most likely derived from an antisense transcript of FLC. Interacts with SOC1 and FT chromatin in vivo. Member of a protein complex.

The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, which we named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.

Encodes an enzyme with histone acetyltransferase activity that can use both H3 and H4 histones as substrates.  No  single prior lysine acetylation is sufficient to block HAC5 acetylation of the H3 or H4 peptides,  suggesting that HAC5 can acetylate any  of several lysines present in the peptides. Di-acetylation of  both lysines 9 and 14 on the H3 peptide significantly reduces  the level of incorporated radioactive acetylation catalyzed by  HAC5, indicating that HAC5 may acetylate either lysine 9 or  lysine 14.

PPD1 (and its paralog, PPD2) encode plant-specific putative DNA-binding proteins. PPD1 and PPD2 are not found in grasses. Overexpression of PPD reduces lamina size by promoting the early arrest of dispersed meristematic cells DMC proliferation during leaf and silique development. Deletion of the PPD locus increases leaf lamina size and results in dome-shaped rather than flat leaves. Siliques are also altered in shape because of extra lamina growth. The curvature of a deltappd leaf reflects the difference between excess growth of the lamina and a limitation to the extension capacity of its perimeter.

Membrane-associated and ATP-independent metalloprotease; EGY1 protein contains eight trans-membrane domains at its C-terminus, and carries out beta-casein degradation in an ATP-independent manner. EGY1 is required for development of both thylakoid grana and a well-organized lamellae system in chloroplast. Additionally, EGY1 is required for the accumulation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b binding (CAB) proteins (both PS I and PS II) in chloroplast membranes, and for grana formation and normal chloroplast development. Loss of EGY1 function also has an effect on endodermal plastid biogenesis. Mutant studies suggest that EGY1 is involved in the regulation of nuclear gene expression response to ammonium stress and interacts with ABA signaling.

It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.

Membrane-bound protein serine/threonine kinase that functions as blue light photoreceptor in redundancy with PHO1. Involved in stomatal opening, chloroplast movement and phototropism. Mediates blue light-induced growth enhancements. PHOT1 and PHOT2 mediate blue light-dependent activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cell protoplasts. PHOT2 possesses two LOV (LOV1 and LOV2, for light-oxygen-voltage-sensing) domains involved in FMN-binding and a C-terminus forming a serine/threonine kinase domain. LOV2 acts as an inhibitor of phototropin kinase in the dark, and light cancels the inhibition through cysteine-FMN adduct formation. LOV1 in contrast acts as an attenuator of photoactivation.  Localized to the Golgi apparatus under the induction of blue light.

Encodes a [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like protein named Gollum (for Growth in different Oxygen LeveLs in&#64258;Uences Morphogenesis).  Heterologous expression of Gollum in E. coli indicates that it probably contains two [Fe-S] clusters with different magnetic properties. Sequence alignment analysis indicates that these two clusters would be topologically equivalent to the mesial and proximal [Fe-S] centers of [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Knockdown mutants (RNAi) show a dwarf phenotype at the normal atmospheric partial oxygen pressure of 21 kPa.  This dwarf phenotype could be rescued by growing the plant under low oxygen pressure (5kPa), suggesting a role for this gene in oxygen sensing.

DCP1 forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP2 (At5g13570) and VCS (VARICOSE) (At3g13300). However, unlike DCP2, DCP1 itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. The protein was shown by immunoprecipitation not to interact with DCP2.

Encodes XPB1, a DNA repair protein and transcription factor.  Arabidopsis thaliana has duplicated XPB gene (AtXPB1 and AtXPB2, with high similarity to each other). XPB proteins are involved in both DNA repair and transcription, they are component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and are responsible for DNA helicase activity during nucleotide (nt) excision repair (NER). Complementation assays in yeast rad25 mutant strains suggest the involvement of AtXPB2 in DNA repair.

Encodes an &#945;-glucan, water dikinase required for starch degradation. Involved  in cold-induced freezing tolerance. Mutations that eliminate the GWD protein or affect the dikinase domain of the enzyme dramatically reduce both the amount of phosphate in the amylopectin and the rate of starch degradation. Mature leaves of these mutants accumulate amounts of starch up to seven times greater than those in wild-type leaves. NMR analysis of the mutants, suggests that the gene is specifically involved in the phosphorylation of the glucosyl residues of starch at the C6 position.

Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. %01H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10%E2%80%9320 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

The LIP1 gene encodes a small GTPase that influences the light input pathway of the plant circadian network. An MBP:LIP1 fusion protein has GTP hydrolyzing abilities in vitro. In plants, LIP1 seems to play a negative role in regulating circadian period that can be suppressed by light. LIP1 also seems to negatively affect light-pulse-dependent resetting of the clock, especially during the first portion of the subjective evening. LIP1 expression levels are not significantly affected by the circadian clock in seedlings grown under LL conditions. The levels of the YFP:LIP1 protein expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, shows a low amplitude variation, with protein levels peaking near the beginning of subjective night under LL conditions. In hypocotyl epidermal cells of dark and light-grown seedlings, a YFP:LIP1 fusion protein can be seen in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and does not cluster in nuclear speckles. LIP1 may also be involved in photomorphogenesis.

Encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase that may act as a positive regulator of cellular auxin efflux, as a a binary switch for PIN polarity, and as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain. Negative regulator of root hair growth. PID kinase activity is critical for the inhibition of root hair growth and for maintaining  the proper subcellular localization of PID.

During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10%E2%80%9320 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

Encodes a protein similar to ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling proteins of the ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 family. Genetic analyses suggest that this gene is involved in multiple flowering pathways. Mutations in PIE1 results in suppression of FLC-mediated delay of flowering and causes early flowering in noninductive photoperiods independently of FLC. PIE1 is required for expression of FLC in the shoot apex but not in the root.Along with ARP6 forms a complex to deposit modified histone H2A.Z at several loci within the genome. This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6).

Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

Originally identified as a mutation that causes floral organs to fuse together. About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.

Encodes a putative transcription factor MEDEA (MEA) that negatively regulates seed development in the absence of fertilization. Mutations in this locus result in embryo lethality.  MEA is a Polycomb group gene that is imprinted in the endosperm.  The maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is silent.  MEA is controlled by DEMETER (DME), a DNA glycosylase required to activate MEA expression, and METHYLTRANSFERASE I (MET1), which maintains CG methylation at the MEA locus. MEA is  involved in the negative regulation of its own imprinted gene expression; the effect is not only allele-specific but also  dynamically regulated during seed development. In the ovule, the MEA transcripts  are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization  and gradually decrease after fertilization

In Arabidopsis, the RPT5 subunit is encoded by two highly homologous genes, RPT5a and RPT5b.  RPT5a and RPT5b show accession-dependent functional redundancy.  In Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: mutant alleles of RPT5a displayed 50% pollen lethality, indicating that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. In the Columbia (Col) accession, a rpt5a mutant allele did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte, whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not. Double rpt5a rpt5b mutants in Col background showed a complete male and female gametophyte lethal phenotype.

Encodes a member of the R protein complex and may represent a virulence target of type III pili effector proteins (virulence factors) from bacterial pathogens, which is 'guarded' by R protein complex (RPM1 and RPS2 proteins). RIN4 physically interacts with RPS2 and RPM1 in vivo. Bacterial avirulence (Avr) effectors AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 induce a mobility shift in RIN4 and expression of AvrRpt2 induces rapid degradation of RIN4. RIN4 contains 2 sites for AvrRpt2 autocleavage, called RCS1 and RCS2. Overexpression of RIN4 inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function and also inhibits PAMP-induced defense signaling. Attached to the plasma membrane at its carboxyl terminus. Cleaved  by AvrRpt2 at two PxFGxW motifs, one releasing a large portion of RIN4 from the  plasma membrane and both exposing amino-terminal residues that destabilized the carboxyl-terminal cleavage products by targeting them for N-end ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Major virulence target of the TTSE HopF2Pto.

A member of mei2-like gene family, predominantly plant-based family of genes encoding RNA binding proteins with characteristic presence of a highly conserved RNA binding motif first described in the mei2 gene of the fission yeast S. pombe. In silico analyses reveal nine mei2 -like genes in A. thaliana. They were grouped into four distinct clades, based on overall sequence similarity and subfamily-specific sequence elements. AML5 is a member of two sister clades of mei2-like gene family, AML1 through AML5, and belongs to the clade named ALM235. Among mei2-like genes, AML5 is the transcript with highest frequency of alternative splicing. Expression was detected during embryo development (heart and torpedo stage) and in vegetative and floral apices.

Encodes a member of the basic helix loop helix family of transcription factors. Loss of RGE1 function causes shriveled seeds that contain small embryos. The cuticle in the embryos does not develop normally, possible due to the adeherence of the endosperm to the developing embryo. RGE1 is expressed in the endosperm surrounding region which directly surrounds the developing embryo, however it exerts its effect non autonomously- in the developing embryo. Mutant seedlings are extremely sensitive to dessication due to the abnormal cuticle.

CytADR/SDR1 is an aldehyde reductase that catalyzes the reduction of the aldehyde carbonyl groups on alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes with more than 5 carbons in vitro. It can also act on menthone and neomenthol in vitro, but these do not represent likely endogenous activities of this enzyme in planta. GFP-tagged CytADR appears to localize to the cytosol where it likely plays a role in detoxifying reactive carbonyls. sdr1 mutants have altered responses to pathogens.

The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus.

Separase is a capase family protease required for the release of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis and mitosis.  Arabidopsis separase contains a predicted 2Fe2S-ferredoxin domain that is not present in the proteins of other organisms. Also contains a putative EF-hand calcium binding domain. Mutant seeds exhibited embryo arrest at the globular stage. The endosperm also exhibited a weak titan-like phenotype. Transgenic plants expressing AESP RNA interference (RNAi) from the meiosis-specific DMC1 promoter exhibited alterations in chromosome segregation during meiosis I and II that resulted in polyads containing from one to eight microspores. Plays an essential role in embryo development.  Required for the removal of cohesin from meiotic chromosomes and establishment of meiotic nuclear domains. This gene was also identified through the rsw4 mutant. Lines carrying recessive, temperature-sensitive mutations exhibit reduced anisotropic growth at 30 degrees Celsius. Microtubules and cellulose microfibrils are not depleted or disoriented in the mutants at the restrictive temperature.

The PARVUS/GLZ1 gene encodes a putative family 8 glycosyl transferase that contributes to xylan biosynthesis. Its gene expression shows good co-variance with the IRX3 gene involved in secondary cell wall synthesis. PARVUS/GLZ1 is predicted to have galacturonosyltransferase activity and may be involved in the formation of the complex oligosaccharide sequence present at the reducing end of xylan. PARVUS is expressed in cells undergoing secondary wall thickening, and parvus mutants have thinner cell walls.

Transcriptional activator of genes required for both embryo maturation and cellular differentiation. Sequence is similar to HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box binding factor. HAP3 subunit is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal A domain, a central B domain, and a carboxyl-terminal C domain. LEC1 shared high similarity with other HAP3 homologs only in central, B domain. LEC1 is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. It was sufficient to induce embryogenic programs in vegetative cells, suggesting that LEC1 is a major embryonic regulator that mediates the switch between embryo and vegetative development. Mutants are desiccation intolerant, have trichomes on cotyledons and exhibit precocious meristem activation. Levels of the ABI3 and FUS3 transcripts were significantly reduced in developing siliques of the lec1-1 mutants, indicating that LEC1 down-regulates FUS3 and ABI3.When LEC1 is overexpressed from an inducible promoter, the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is increased suggesting a role in positive regulation of FA biosynthesis.

Phenotype of the arp4-1 mutant allele revealed partial sterility due to defects in anther development. Targeting the distinct, 3' UTR of AtARP4 transcripts with RNA interference caused a drastic reduction in the level of AtARP4 protein expression, and resulted in strong pleiotropic phenotypes such as altered organization of plant organs, early flowering, delayed flower senescence and high levels of sterility. Western blot analysis and immunolabelling demonstrated a clear correlation between reductions in the level of AtARP4 expression and severity of the phenotypes.

Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity.

Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. In Arabidopsis, mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants. It also attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence and cell death. This gene product is also involved in nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.

Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment.

Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.

Encodes one of two Arabidopsis proteins with similarity to the TBP-associated factor TAF12.  The gene product is an EIN3-interacting TFIID transcription factor required for proper ethylene response, including ERF1 induction.  Loss of function mutants show enhanced response to ethylene. Located in nucleus and expressed throughout the plant. Required for ERF1 expression. Cytokinin-hypersensitive 1 (CKH1) mutants are characterized by rapidly growing calli with a green color at low levels of cytokinins, which are insufficient to induce such cytokinin responses in wild-type explants. It is hypothesized that CKH1 acts as a negative regulator of cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis.

Encodes an atypical subtype of the ARR (Arabidopsis response regulator) protein family. ARR22 is more similar to the receiver domains of hybrid kinases than other response regulators. It acts as a phosphohistidine phosphatase when tested with phospho-AHP5 in vitro suggesting that it might be involved in a two-component phosphorelay. Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root, shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators.

Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal SKL targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.
