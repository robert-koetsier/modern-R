# modern-R

1. For this workshop, I recommend working in an interactive environment such as RStudio.
2. You can find the exercises in the script `R/tidyverse_exercises.qmd`, which you can edit to include your solutions.
3. To see the solutions I had in mind when writing the exercises, refer to `R/solutions.html`.
